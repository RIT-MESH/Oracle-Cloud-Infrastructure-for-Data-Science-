### Configuring a Data Science Tenancy

First we need to create a Tanancy.  You can think of the tenancy as your account,
but it is also a secure and isolated partition within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure where you can create, 
organize, and administer your cloud resources. Following are the steps for it.

1. Creating a Data Scientists User Group.

2. Creating a Compartment for Your Work.

3. (Optional) Creating a VCN and Subnet.

4. Creating Policies.

5. Creating a Dynamic Group with Policies.

6. Creating a Notebook Session.

### Next step is creating a Model Catalog
The model catalog is a centralized and managed repository of model artifacts. 
Models stored in the model catalog can be shared across members of a team and they can be loaded back into a notebook session.
Create a model and save it to the model catalog by using the ADS SDK, OCI Python SDK, or the Console.
After you store a Data Science model in the model catalog, it can be deployed as an HTTP endpoint as model deployment.
1. Creating and Saving a Model with the ADS SDK
   
2. Creating and Saving a Model with the OCI Python SDK
   
3. Creating and Saving a Model with the Console

4. Exporting a Large Model Artifact
 
5. Importing a Large Model Artifact
